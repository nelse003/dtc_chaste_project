abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The luminal surface of the gut is lined with a monolayer of epithelial cells that acts as a nutrient absorptive engine and protective barrier. To maintain its integrity and functionality, the epithelium is renewed every few days. Theoretical models are powerful tools that can be used to test hypotheses concerning the regulation of this renewal process, to investigate how its dysfunction can lead to loss of homeostasis and neoplasia, and to identify potential therapeutic interventions. Here we propose a new multiscale model for crypt dynamics that links phenomena occurring at the subcellular, cellular and tissue levels of organisation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: At the subcellular level, deterministic models characterise molecular networks, such as cell-cycle control and Wnt signalling. The output of these models determines the behaviour of each epithelial cell in response to intra-, inter- and extracellular cues. The modular nature of the model enables us to easily modify individual assumptions and analyse their effects on the system as a whole.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We perform virtual microdissection and labelling-index experiments, evaluate the impact of various model extensions, obtain new insight into clonal expansion in the crypt, and compare our predictions with recent mitochondrial DNA mutation data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that relaxing the assumption that stem-cell positions are fixed enables clonal expansion and niche succession to occur. We also predict that the presence of extracellular factors near the base of the crypt alone suffices to explain the observed spatial variation in nuclear beta-catenin levels along the crypt axis.},

abstract = {We present a novel class of spatial models of cell movement and arrangement applied to the two-dimensional cellular organization of the intestinal crypt. The model differs from earlier approaches in using a dynamic movement on a lattice-free cylindrical surface. Cell movement is a consequence of mitotic activity. Cells interact by viscoelastic forces. Voronoi tessellation permits simulations of individual cell boundaries. Simulations can be compared with experimental data obtained from cell scoring in sections. Simulation studies show that the model is consistent with the experimental results for the spatial distribution of labelling indices, mitotic indices and other observed phenomena using a fixed number of stem cells and a fixed number of transit cell divisions.},

@article{Swat2004,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: Mathematical models of the cell cycle can contribute to an understanding of its basic mechanisms. Modern simulation tools make the analysis of key components and their interactions very effective. This paper focuses on the role of small modules and feedbacks in the gene-protein network governing the G1/S transition in mammalian cells. Mutations in this network may lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation. Bifurcation analysis helps to identify the key components of this extremely complex interaction network. RESULTS: We identify various positive and negative feedback loops in the network controlling the G1/S transition. It is shown that the positive feedback regulation of E2F1 and a double activator-inhibitor module can lead to bistability. Extensions of the core module preserve the essential features such as bistability. The complete model exhibits a transcritical bifurcation in addition to bistability. We relate these bifurcations to the cell cycle checkpoint and the G1/S phase transition point. Thus, core modules can explain major features of the complex G1/S network and have a robust decision taking function.},
